          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <h3>Afrikan Clothing Co. is a social enterprise with the goal of employing women in Kenya to design and construct custom apparel out of wax prints — a traditional African fabric — to be sold via an online store to women in the United States and eventually Europe. All profits from the enterprise will be funneled into a foundation managed by the same women Afrikan Clothing Co. employs. Its purpose  will be to distribute funds to programs aimed at helping women and girls in East Africa gain access to education and vocational training.</h3>
          <p>The foundation received an initial grant from Mercy Corps to get operations up and running, but need additional funding to continue their mission. They plan to raise this capital through the crowdfunding platform StartSomeGood. They asked me to build them a website to serve as a platform for educating people about Afrikan Clothing Co.’s mission, why the focus on East Africa, and direct visitors toward their crowdfunding site.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="acc-overview-problem">
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>In order to procure additional funding, Afrikan Clothing Co. needed a professional website for potential donors to learn about the enterprise, gain a deeper understanding of its mission, and see what kinds of products will be offered in its initial product line. The main goal of the site was to be informative, educating visitors about East Africa and why Kenya in particular is the perfect environment, both socially and economically, to spur positive change in the region.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="acc-overview-solution">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>The development of a website would help Afrikan Clothing Co. in a number of ways. Not only would it serve as a destination for learning about the enterprise and the products it plans to offer in its first product line, but it would help bring credibility to the brand and to its mission to facilitate change for women and girls in a region of the world often overlooked by western interests.</p>

        <h1>Research</h1>
        <h3>I relied heavily on the founder of Afrikan Clothing Co. to provide me background on who she sees as its target consumers based off of her own research as well as who she envisions the crowdfunding campaign to be aimed at. I followed up my initial discussion with her with a more formal interview, the answers from which served as a foundation for building personas and user stories to inform the organization and layout of the site.</h3>

With the main goal of the site to educate users about the brand and its mission with the hope that they will want to pledge to the cause and help fund the project, I tried to ensure no blocks of text were too large to digest and they were surrounded by beautiful large photos showcasing Kenya, the country this social enterprise hopes to empower.

          <p>The client did not have actual examples of her products to photograph and display on the products page since she was still in the midst of obtaining funding to get her company off the ground. She did, however, have flat line drawings of the four products that were to make up her initial product line, as well as swatches of the wax prints she intended to use for these first styles. I thought a creative way to showcase the prints in conjunction with the pieces they were going to be featured on would be to recreate each wax print digitally and show them alongside their corresponding flat line drawing. I did this by breaking each print down into the smallest geometric shapes I could and then layered them together to recreate each print. On the products page I incorporated a parallax effect on each wax print - removing the effect on mobile screen sizes in favor of better usability.</p>
