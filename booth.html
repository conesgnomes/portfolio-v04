            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h4>I was hired by Sitecast to help redesign the Booth Lake Landing Resort website. The original site, though perhaps modern in its day, was incredibly dated and in need of a makeover, both from a user interface and user experience perspective. It was crucial for the owner of Booth Lake Landing that the site reflect what she referred to as the “Northwoods aesthetic”, allowing visitors to get a visual sense of the region as they explored the site to help them get a glimpse of the area’s beauty before stepping foot onto the resort.</h4>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Problem</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The client wanted the visual design to have an app-like quality to it, which they believed would help modernize its look and feel. In addition to a UI overhaul, there was a need to build out a more straight-forward UX for the site’s cabin reservation process without relying on an online booking tool (the client still wanted to manage reservations via email).</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Solution</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I utilized design built upon components to mimic the app-like feel the client was after. I brought a sense of the Northwoods into the site by incorporating photos of the region into the backgrounds of every page, relying on a transparent layering effect to ensure as much imagery was visible as possible. I reimagined the contact and cabin booking process to help establish a straightforward user flow, making it easy for visitors to request a cabin reservation.</p>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Research</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I completed an analysis of design elements currently used in pharmaceutical and medical device websites, emails, and banner ads, both those done by Evoke Giant, as well as brands worked on by competitor agencies, to establish list of components to include in the Giant Design System. I also worked closely with our UX Strategist and Director of UX to focus the list of components needed for the initial launch of GDS.</p>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Typography</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I established a typographic heirarchy  for the GDS that could be used across any project. It provides an example of appropriate type sizing, agnostic of typeface, font weight, and case.</p>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Color</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I created a color palette to be used for the GDS that expands upon Evoke Giant’s corporate colors. It’s meant to serve as an example for color selection and will obviously be replaced by a client’s own brand colors.</p>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Page Elements</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The beauty of the Giant Design System is its modular nature. In true atomic design fashion, each element can combined with other elements to create full page designs.</p>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Interactivity</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I ensured to include hover, active, and other interactive states into the design system.</p>

            <h2>Considerations and Next Steps</h2>
            <h4>When working with smaller businesses on you have to take into account the limitations of time and budget when planning and designing projects. In addition you are ultimately working within their level of comfort when pushing the boundaries of design and aesthetics.</h4>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Fully Incorporate Booking</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The client wanted to manage their cabin reservation process via email, though given the time and resources I believe a fully integrated reservation process would be ideal. This would require significantly less work for the client when booking out cabins as much of the process could be automated or significantly streamlined - think calendar and cabin management, payment processing, communications - just to name a few. It would eliminate the need to deal with stacks of emails from interested guests and enable an all-in-one POS system.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">User Interface</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The UI design of this particular project went through a number of iterations as it was ultimately figured out what kind of a visual look and feel the client liked most. Ultimately it was determined that they wanted photos of the region incorporated into the backgrounds of each screen, an aesthetic choice that resulted in a design that was not my favorite of the options we worked through, however the client was happy, and it taught me the lesson of negotiation and compromise.</p>
