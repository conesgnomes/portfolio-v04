            <h4>Our client, a biotechnology company, was coming to market with a revolutionary new cancer treatment. They tasked us with creating an iPad app that could be used by company reps when speaking with doctors to educate them about how the process works, the benefits of it, as well as display its safety and outcome data in an easy to digest way.</h4>
            <p class="confidentiality-statement">All content has been blinded to maintain client confidentiality.</p>

              <img src="img/cva-landing-tablet-black.png" alt="Desktop and mobile view of Booth Lake Landing Resorts' landing page">
            </div>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Problem</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">Our client wanted a digital tool that would allow their reps to quickly and easily walk through all aspects of their new product with doctors. Reps have no more than 30 minutes to spend with doctors, so the tool needed to present complex data and information while being simple to navigate so they can customize their presentation to the individual doctor they are speaking with.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The content and visual look and feel of this app would to serve as the base for all of the other digital pieces that our client would be releasing alongside it for their product launch. This included separate patient- and doctor-facing websites, email campaigns, and digital banner ads.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Solution</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">Our app allows for reps to quickly jump to specific content sections so they can tailor their conversations to be uniquely relevant to each doctor they speak with since, for example, one doctor may be more concerned with safety while another is focused more on success rates.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">We built a design system that could be used across our client's entire digital ecosystem. This included charts, graphs, tables, and infographics alongside the expected UI components.</p>
            <h3 class="paragaph-header">Team and Role</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I was the lead UX/UI designer on the project and I worked with a range of people from the art, copy, and engineering teams, but those that I collaborated with most frequently were:</p>
            <div class="team-group">
              <ul>
                <li>Creative director — David Bloom</li>
                <li>Senior copywriter — Felicity Pal</li>
                <li>Lead developer — Ryan Cowie</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Account lead — Amy Lane</li>
                <li>Digital producer — Dan Hunt</li>
                <li>Project manager — Dana Wolheim</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Scope and constraints</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">This project needed to be designed and developed in just under 8 months to ensure it went live alongside the launch of the cancer treatment. Built into this timing was four rounds of three-week long legal reviews to ensure all claims, data, charts, and graphs passed the FDA’s stringent requirements for medical accuracy.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section design-section">
            <div id="design-anchor"></div>
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <h4>The design process began with outlining the app's requirements as supplied by our client and their legal team. We translated those into wireframes to establish functionality, followed by the creation of design system components, and finished with high-fidelity mock ups. Between each of these phases we met with our client's legal team to confirm adherence to FDA rules and regulations.</h4>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Strategy</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">For ease of navigation and a customizable flow, each screen of the app would feature top-level takeaways with additional supporting data or graphics accessible via screen overlays. This would allow reps to keep their conversations high-level, while having the ability to dig deeper on each topic if the doctor they were speaking with wanted to.</p>
            <div class="cva-wireframe-group">
              <h3 class="paragraph-header">Wireframes</h3>
              <p class="paragraph-copy">I created wireframes for every screen within each section to illustrate our proposed structure and functionality to the client. We sent the wireframes through their legal review to ensure our proposed design was acceptable before moving forward into higher-fidelity layouts.</p>
              <h4>Functionality</h4>
              <p class="paragraph-copy">Some of the functional requirements were dictated by our client to keep the app consistent with other tools their reps were familiar with, while others were developed by our team to streamline the app's interface.</p>

              <p class="paragraph-copy">There were a few elements each screen needed to have to pass our client's legal review. I decided to keep all of this contained at the bottom of each screen.</p>
