            <h4>Our client, a biotechnology company, was coming to market with a revolutionary new cancer treatment. They tasked us with creating an iPad app that could be used by company reps when speaking with doctors to educate them about how the process works, the benefits of it, as well as display its safety and outcome data in an easy to digest way.</h4>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Problem</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">Our client wanted a digital tool that would allow their reps to quickly and easily walk through all features, safety, and outcome data of their new cancer treatment with doctors. The tool needed to present complex data and information in a way that was simple to navigate, while balancing the large amount of content that was legally required to be present on each screen.</p>
            <!-- <p class="paragraph-copy">The content and visual look and feel of this app would to serve as the base for all of the other digital pieces that our client would be releasing alongside it for their product launch. This included separate patient- and doctor-facing websites, email campaigns, and digital banner ads.</p> -->
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Solution</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The finished app allows for reps to easily explain all aspects of our client's new treatment to doctors. It's designed to best facilitate a rep's ability to have a short, detail-rich conversation with doctors and visually show the features and benefits of our client's new cancer treatment.</p>
            <!-- <p class="paragraph-copy"

            conversations to be uniquely relevant to each doctor they speak with since, for example, one doctor may be more concerned with safety while another is focused more on success rates.

            >We built a design system that could be used across our client's entire digital ecosystem. This included charts, graphs, tables, and infographics alongside the expected UI components.</p> -->
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Scope and constraints</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">This project needed to be designed and developed in just under 8 months to ensure it went live alongside the launch of our client's cancer treatment. Built into this timing was four rounds of three-week long legal reviews to ensure all claims, data, charts, and functionality passed the FDA’s stringent requirements for medical accuracy.</p>
            <h3 class="paragaph-header">Team and Role</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I was the lead UX/UI designer on the project and I worked with a range of people from the art, copy, and engineering teams, but those that I collaborated with most frequently were:</p>
            <!-- <div> -->
              <ul class="team-group">
                <li>Creative director — David Bloom</li>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <h4>The design process began with outlining the app's requirements as supplied by our client and their legal team. We translated those into wireframes to establish functionality, followed by the creation of design system components, and finished with high-fidelity mock ups. Between each of these phases we met with our client's legal team to confirm adherence to FDA rules and regulations.</h4>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Strategy</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">For ease of navigation and a customizable flow, each screen of the app would feature condensed, streamlined content with additional supporting data or graphics accessible via screen overlays. This would allow reps to keep their conversations high-level, while having the ability to dig deeper on each topic if the doctor they were speaking with wanted to.</p>

              <h3 class="paragraph-header">Functionality and wireframes</h3>
              <p class="paragraph-copy">I created wireframes for every screen within each section to illustrate our proposed structure and functionality to the client. We sent the wireframes through their legal review to ensure our proposed design was approved by our client and their lawyers before moving forward into higher-fidelity layouts.</p>
