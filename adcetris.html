            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h4>Adcetris is a drug that treats six types of lymphoma (a type of cancer). While working at Evoke Giant, I was placed on a team tasked with improving the usabilty and reducing the bouce rates of the Adcetris.com homepage. This homepage serves as a gateway into six different sections of the site, each section containing specific information about how Adcetris is used in relation to each lymphoma type. Since Adcetris is used differently for each condition, ensuring users knew how to access the section of the site related to their type of lymphoma was crucial.</h4>

            </div>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Problem</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">Data pulled from Google Analytics and Hotjar showed that users were not progressing into the lymphoma type-specific sections of the website, and were instead scrolling up and down the page before leaving the site all together (bouncing). This meant that not only were users not entering the section of the website specific to their type of lymphoma, but more importantly implied that they weren't understanding how to move beyond the homepage at all. We focused our project on the mobile experience first since that is where the majority of site visits were originating.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Solution</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">We relied on heatmap, click/tap tracking, and user testing data to inform our redesign of the Adcetris.com landing page. The chosen design solution better communicates intended user behavior which ultimately reduces bounce and ensures users enter the interior pages related to their type of lymphoma.</p>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Research</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The reservation process was most in need of an overhaul, so I did compentitive research and looked at reservation processes across other hotel and resort websites. The common elements I saw in the market, but found missing from the current Booth Lake site were the ability to access reservations directly from room detail pages, a calendar showing room availability directly on the room's information page, and a quick breakdown of room features and amenities.</p>

            <h4>This project was a full top-to-bottom overhaul starting with redesigning the site's information architecture and sitemap, as well as a UI redesign and streamlining of its UX and user flows.</h4>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">UX</h3>
            <p>On the Bookings page, I created a step-by-step process to walk users through reserving a cabin. Step one asks the user to select which cabin they’re interested in via a dropdown menu. Once selected, that cabin’s availability calendar and pricing information pops up with a second step requesting they select which dates they wish to visit. Step three is where users enter their contact information so Booth Lake Landing can connect back with them via email, collect their payment information, and finalize their booking.</p>

            </div>
            <p>To work in concert with the Bookings page, I consolidated all cabin information onto each cabin’s Overview page. This allows users to see all the relevant details about each cabin — photos, a description, and pricing information — as well as that cabin’s availability calendar, all from the same screen.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">UI</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">My PM at Sitecast wanted to ensure the site had a modern, app-like feel. To accomplish this I incorporated layers, transparency, and shadows, as well as brought in design elements often used in mobile apps like modal overlays and forward and back buttons on pages, allowing users to navigate within the site (such as between individual cabin or activity overviews).</p>
            <div class="booth-ui-group">
              <img src="img/booth-ui-elements-desktop.png" alt="Card showing all the project's UI elements">
            </div>
            <p>To incorporate regional photography per the client's wishes, I utilized photos with dark and light overlays for the majority of the backgrounds on each page, sometimes using multiple images to break up pages with clearly delineated sections. I played with transparency of site elements to allow the photography to show through as much as possible.</p>

            <h2>Considerations and Next Steps</h2>
            <h4>When working with smaller businesses on you have to take into account the limitations of time and budget when planning and designing projects. In addition you are ultimately working within their level of comfort when pushing the boundaries of design and aesthetics.</h4>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Platform Limitations</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The platform that this project was hosted on is called Sitecast. It is a web hosting and development platform that makes development straight forward and quick, though has limitations in terms of functionality and visual acuity as it is largely drag and drop with little opportunity for customization. I was not fully aware of these limitations when designing this project which resulted in a slight disconnect between design and final dev'd website.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Fully Incorporate Booking</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The client wanted to manage their cabin reservation process via email, though given the time and resources I believe a fully integrated reservation process would be ideal. This would require significantly less work for the client when booking out cabins as much of the process could be automated or significantly streamlined - think calendar and cabin management, payment processing, communications - just to name a few. It would eliminate the need to deal with stacks of emails from interested guests and enable an all-in-one POS system.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">User Interface</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The UI design of this particular project went through a number of iterations as I ultimately figured out what kind of a visual look and feel the client liked most. In the end they wanted photos of the region incorporated into the backgrounds of each screen, an aesthetic choice that resulted in a design that was not my favorite of the options we worked through, however the client was happy, and it taught me the lesson of negotiation and compromise.</p>
