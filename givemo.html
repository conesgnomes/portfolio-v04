          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <h3>Givemo was the culminating group project for my JavaScript course. The idea for this project was to create an app that allowed users to find charities in Portland, Oregon by category and easily make a monetary donation to them. In a world ever more cluttered by information, this app would allow users to cut through the noise and easily find causes they believe in to support. My group and I built the app in Angular 4, stored our data in a Firebase database, and used SCSS for the styling. I played the part of principle designer along with one of my classmates, coming up with the overall UX and UI design for the application, while also helping code and style the app.</h3>

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>We were broken into groups of four and had one week to design and code a fully functional Angular application of our choice. Inspired by our current socio-political climate, I wanted to develop an app that would remove as many barriers as possible in helping individuals give back to their communities and do so in a streamlined, elegant fashion. I proposed the idea of creating a mobile app that would allow users to find charities or non-profits in their local communitiy and make a donation to them with the click of a button.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="givemo-overview-solution">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>The app we developed accomplished everything we set out to do - it provided one-touch single-sign-on via Google, a landing page where users could track which charities they had already donated to, and a dynamic search screen that allowed users to search via category or charity name, all with an easy-to-use and attractive user interface.</p>

        <h3>Due to the limited timeframe on this project — only one one week from inception to final delivery — the time to thoroughly research the solution was limited at best. My team and I relied on our own knowledge of how payment apps such as Venmo, SquareCash, and PayPal work and conducted interviews with other students in our class in order to build user stories from which to generate our designs.</h3>

      <div class="ux-text">
        <h2>UX</h2>
        <p>The goal for the UX of the app was to make every interaction as intuitive as possible and follow the heuristics made commonplace in other mobile apps. We incorporated single sign in with a user’s Google account (additional sign in options via Facebook and personal email address were discussed, though due to our limited time frame we picked one and went with it) which led direclty to a landing screen that doubled as the user’s profile. This put all of the user’s relevant information immediately up front, allowing them to easily see how much money they had donated overall, a breakdown of causes they had donated to in the past, and the ability to donate to them again right from their profile page.</p>
        <p>Within the search screen, users are given a set of predetermined categories to search by, allowing them to easily jump to the types of non-profits they might be intersted in supporting. The list updates dynamically, so as the user chooses additional categories to search by, the relevant non-profits get added into the generated list for a smooth experience that does not require a page reload. Once a user finds a non-profit they’re interested in supporting, they’re able to add it to their favorites list to donate to later or make a donation directly from the search screen.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ui-group">
        <h2>UI</h2>
        <p>The user interface was designed to be simple and easy to use with large buttons and bright colors. In coming up with the colors for the app, I wanted to try and incorporate a color gradient, since I had been seeing them used in many popular apps. I thought a great way to do so would be to place yellow and blue on either side of the gradient, so when the colors blended together, they would create a beautiful green color, calling to mind the app’s purpose of allowing users to make monetary donations.</p>
