            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h4>Adcetris is a drug that treats six subtypes of lymphoma (a type of cancer). Our client tasked our team with improving the usabilty and reducing the bouce rates of the Adcetris.com homepage. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research we designed and launched a new, better-performing version of the homepage.</h4>

            </div>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Problem</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">Data pulled from Google Analytics and Hotjar showed that users were not moving beyond the homepage and were instead scrolling up and down the page before leaving the site all together (bouncing), implying that they weren't understanding how to move beyond the homepage. The homepage also didn't feature any copy clearly describing what the drug is used for. We focused our project on the mobile experience since that is where the majority of site visits were originating.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Solution</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">We relied on heatmap, click/tap tracking, and user testing data to inform our redesign of the Adcetris.com landing page. The chosen design solution better communicates intended user behavior which ultimately reduces bounce and ensures users enter the interior pages related to their type of lymphoma.</p>
            <h3 class="paragaph-header">Team and Role</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>UX/UI designer — myself</li>
              <li>UX researcher — Emily Schepp</li>

              <li>Senior copywriter — Helen Wilson</li>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h4>We attacked the problem from multiple angles to ensure we came up with a well-rounded solution. We utilized <a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.hotjar.com/">Hotjar</a> to track user click/tap and scroll behavior, explored the competitive landscape to evaluate how other multi-condition medications designed their websites to help users navigate, as well as conducted remote user testing of our proposed design solutions with <a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.usabilityhub.com/">UsabilityHub</a>.</h4>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Scroll behavior</h3>
            <div class="lymph-scroll-group">
              <div class="lymph-scroll-copy">
                <p class="paragraph-copy">Diving into scroll behavior on Hotjar led us to believe that users were confused about how to interact with the page and resorted to scrolling to hunt for a solution:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>66% of users began scrolling within 6 seconds, assuring us visitors were indeed scrolling down the page</li>
                  <li>74% of users scrolled past the average page fold, thereby seeing any content that was not immediately visible upon landing on the page</li>
                  <li>34% of users would scroll to the bottom of the page and then scroll back to the top, suggesting two possibilities: either they couldn't find content relevant to them to engage with; or they were unclear how to engage with the site, implying ineffective use of call to actions (CTAs) on the page</li>
                  <li>97% of users would bounce without interacting with the site in any form</li>
                </ul>

              <div class="lymph-tap-copy">
                <p class="paragraph-copy">Analyzing click/tap behavior indicated that users were unclear where to tap on the page. The CTAs on the page were rarely interacted with and users continually tapped the page logo causing the page to reload. This lead us to believe users were unaware they were on the homepage of the site, and were seeking a homepage with content to interact with:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>53% of users clicked the Adcetris logo, causing the page to reload</li>
                  <li><1% clicked on the CTAs to expand the primary navigation which serves as the gateway into the lymphoma-specific pages of the website</li>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Landscape analysis</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">We analyzed three multi-treatment cancer drug websites to better understand how products with similar requirements went about ensuring their users were able to access the content relevant to them, specifically as it related to navigation. Each site handled navigation slightly differently, resulting in what we determined to be three distinct models: tile, dropdown, and multiple entry point.</p>
            <div class="tile-model-group">
              <div class="tile-model-copy">
                <h4>Tile model</h4>
                <p class="paragraph-copy">This model uses large distinct tiles on the homepage for navigation, clearly communicating which elements users are expected to interact with to navigate into the interior of the website:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Clear instructional copy on each tile</li>
                  <li>Tiles look like buttons and are clearly clickable</li>
                  <li>Language used is simple and patient-friendly; the addition of icons helps provide further clarification</li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <div class="tile-model-image-container">

            <div class="dropdown-model-group">
              <div class="dropdown-model-copy">
                <h4>Dropdown model</h4>
                <p class="paragraph-copy">With the dropdown model, users are prompted to select their cancer type via a dropdown menu. Although this requires the users to take an additional step to see all of their navigation options, the copy instructing them to do so is clear and their choices once presented are straightforward:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Clear instructional copy explaining what action to take</li>
                  <li>When on a mobile device, a hamburger menu is clearly visible at the top of the screen providing a secondary location for users to turn to in search of a path into the site</li>
                  <li>There is prominent copy in the hero space explaining what the drug is used to treat</li>
                </ol>

              <div class="multi-entry-model-copy">
                <h4>Multiple entry point model</h4>
                <p class="paragraph-copy">The multiple entry point model helps ensure users are able to access the section of the website related to their cancer type by providing two ways to navigate to that content – first by providing instructional copy in the global navigation bar and second by including a large instructional CTA button and accompanying links in the hero space of the page:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Clear instructional copy explaining what action to take</li>
                  <li>Global nav provides secondary location for users to select cancer type to proceed into interior pages</li>
                  <li>There is prominent copy in the hero space explaining what the drug is used to treat</li>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Proposed design solutions</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">Scroll, tap/click, and landscape analyses in hand, it was time to synthsize this research into some wireframe solutions for the Adcetris.com homepage and test them on real users to determine which to fully flesh out into a final design. I created three different designs, focusing only on mobile, which we uploaded into UsabilityHub to gather insights from users.</p>

              <div class="solution-one-copy">
                <h4>Solution 1: Tiles</h4>
                <p class="paragraph-copy">The first solution we tested foregoes any hero artwork in favor of placing the CTA buttons front and center. There is also a lymphoma-selection menu in the primary navigation bar:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Prominent copy in the hero space explaining what the drug is used to treat</li>
                  <li>Lymphoma type selector located in primary navigation bar</li>

                <h4>Solution 2: Dropdown</h4>
                <p class="paragraph-copy">The second solution features the hero artwork prominently, while relegating the lymphoma type selection into a dropdown menu with clear instructional copy directing the user to open the menu and select their condition. There is also a lymphoma-selection menu in the primary navigation bar:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Prominent copy in the hero space explaining what the drug is used to treat</li>
                  <li>Lymphoma type selector located in primary navigation bar</li>
                  <li>Large CTA button guiding user to open the dropdown menu and select their lymphoma type</li>

                <h4>Solution 3: Balance of both</h4>
                <p class="paragraph-copy">The third solution incorporates elements from solution one and solution two to strike a balance between  both. The hero artwork is featured prominently, while a CTA button prompts users to engage with the site and autoscrolls them to lymphoma-type selection CTAs in the hero space. There is also a lymphoma-selection menu in the primary navigation bar:</p>
                <ol>

                <p class="paragraph-copy">Our client had limited budget for user testing, so we decided to use UsabilityHub, which is an inexpensive, remote testing tool. We created a preference test on UsabilityHub to help validate which was the preferred design solution.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-copy">We tested on 50 users from the general public (not actual lymphoma patients). We limited our test population to individuals in the key patient age demographic, as well as those who had low to intermediate technical proficiency since many of Adcetris' patients may be older and less familiar with navigating the web.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-copy">Of the three solutions proposed, a statistically significant percentage of users (47%) preferred solution 3: balance of both. This was our client's preferred design solution as well. With the client's blessing we proceeded into full layout design, creating high fidelity desktop and mobile mock ups to be developed and pushed live.</p>

            <h4>The final design that was pushed live contained slight variations from the proposed wireframes due to client input, namely the exclusion of the primary instructional CTA button which was traded out for instructional copy, but ultimately stayed true to the original design. The client also asked that we include a new patient video section to the homepage below the hero space.</h4>

            <p class="paragraph-copy">The latest analytics readouts from Hotjar and Google Analytics (first three weeks of data available at publishing) shows a marked improvement in site performance:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Homepage bounce rates have decreased from 97% bounce to 78% bounce (average bounce rates for pharmaceutical websites is between 70-80%), bringing the site in line with industry standards</li>
              <li>User engagement with lymphoma-specific CTA buttons increased from <1% engagement to 20% engagement; this means that of the 22% of users who navigate beyond the homepage (e.g., don't bounce), 20% are doing so via the lymphoma-specific CTA buttons, showing their effectiveness in guiding users into the site's interior pages</li>

            <h2>Considerations and Next Steps</h2>
            <h4>When working with smaller businesses on you have to take into account the limitations of time and budget when planning and designing projects. In addition you are ultimately working within their level of comfort when pushing the boundaries of design and aesthetics.</h4>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Platform Limitations</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The platform that this project was hosted on is called Sitecast. It is a web hosting and development platform that makes development straight forward and quick, though has limitations in terms of functionality and visual acuity as it is largely drag and drop with little opportunity for customization. I was not fully aware of these limitations when designing this project which resulted in a slight disconnect between design and final dev'd website.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Fully Incorporate Booking</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The client wanted to manage their cabin reservation process via email, though given the time and resources I believe a fully integrated reservation process would be ideal. This would require significantly less work for the client when booking out cabins as much of the process could be automated or significantly streamlined - think calendar and cabin management, payment processing, communications - just to name a few. It would eliminate the need to deal with stacks of emails from interested guests and enable an all-in-one POS system.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">User Interface</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The UI design of this particular project went through a number of iterations as I ultimately figured out what kind of a visual look and feel the client liked most. In the end they wanted photos of the region incorporated into the backgrounds of each screen, an aesthetic choice that resulted in a design that was not my favorite of the options we worked through, however the client was happy, and it taught me the lesson of negotiation and compromise.</p>
