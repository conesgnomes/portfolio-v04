            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Problem</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">Data pulled from Google Analytics and Hotjar showed that users were not moving beyond the homepage and were instead scrolling up and down the page before leaving the site all together (bouncing). The homepage also didn't feature any copy describing what the drug is used for. I focused on mobile first since that was where the majority of site visits were originating.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Solution</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I relied on heatmap, click/tap tracking, and user testing data to inform my redesign of the landing page. The chosen design solution better communicates intended user behavior which ultimately reduces bounce and ensures users find the content they are looking for.</p>

            <h2>Considerations and Next Steps</h2>
            <h4>When working with smaller businesses on you have to take into account the limitations of time and budget when planning and designing projects. In addition you are ultimately working within their level of comfort when pushing the boundaries of design and aesthetics.</h4>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Platform Limitations</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The platform that this project was hosted on is called Sitecast. It is a web hosting and development platform that makes development straight forward and quick, though has limitations in terms of functionality and visual acuity as it is largely drag and drop with little opportunity for customization. I was not fully aware of these limitations when designing this project which resulted in a slight disconnect between design and final dev'd website.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Fully Incorporate Booking</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The client wanted to manage their cabin reservation process via email, though given the time and resources I believe a fully integrated reservation process would be ideal. This would require significantly less work for the client when booking out cabins as much of the process could be automated or significantly streamlined - think calendar and cabin management, payment processing, communications - just to name a few. It would eliminate the need to deal with stacks of emails from interested guests and enable an all-in-one POS system.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">User Interface</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The UI design of this particular project went through a number of iterations as I ultimately figured out what kind of a visual look and feel the client liked most. In the end they wanted photos of the region incorporated into the backgrounds of each screen, an aesthetic choice that resulted in a design that was not my favorite of the options we worked through, however the client was happy, and it taught me the lesson of negotiation and compromise.</p>
