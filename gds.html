            <p class="paragraph-copy">Evoke Giant  was looking for guidance in best practices when designing biotech and pharma product websites to ensure industry standard design solutions were being utilized.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Solution</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">The website and accompanying design system contain some of the most common components and patterns used in biotech and pharma product websites. They were assembled using <a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Brad Frost’s Atomic Design Methodology</a> and were optimized for both desktop and mobile.</p>

            <h4>I completed an analysis and compiled a list of design elements used in biotechnology and pharmaceutical websites both those done by Evoke Giant, as well as brands worked on by competitor agencies. I worked closely with our UX strategist and director of UX to focus the list of components needed.</h4>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Typography</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I established a typographic heirarchy that could be used across any project. It provides an example of appropriate type sizing, agnostic of typeface, font weight, and case.</p>

            <h2>Common design patterns</h2>
            <h4>I came up with solutions for some of the most frequently encountered design problems in pharma and biotech websites, as well as how they translate to mobile. Often the transition to mobile is responsive, but occasionally it must be adaptive.</h4>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Tabs</h3>
            <div class="pattern-copy">
              <p>Tabs can be used to display multiple blocks of data, be it charts or graphs. Using accordions on mobile is an appropriate adaptive solution.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="gds-patterns-img-desktop">
              <img src="img/gds-example-1-desktop.png" alt="Photo of tabs within the Giant Design System">

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">References and switches</h3>
            <div class="pattern-copy-group">
              <div class="pattern-copy-1">
                <h4>1. References as tooltips</h4>
                <p>Pharmaceutical companies rely on peer-reviewed research to justify the efficacy claims they make. Clickable tooltips are a great method for providing instant access to these references; they also translate responsively to mobile.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="pattern-copy-2">
                <h4>2. Toggle switches</h4>
                <p>Switches are useful for toggling between two sets of data, two charts, or really any two elements that belong together. They can be converted responsively or adaptively as accordions in mobile.</p>

            </div>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Carousels</h3>
            <div class="pattern-copy">
              <p>Carousels are used to show a large collection of similar content, such as a library of videos. They translate responsively to mobile as long as the design makes clear through visual cues that the user can swipe to see more content.</p>

            <div class="gds-patterns-img-desktop">

            </div>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Primary navigation menu</h3>
            <div class="pattern-copy">
              <p>A large dropdown menu on desktop can be used to show a robust or complex collection of subpages. When translated to mobile, accordion functionality is a nice solution.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <h4>When building a design system at an agency, every new client project provides an opportunity to expand upon it as new projects require additional design solutions. These new components and patterns will be folded into additional pages of the fictional site to keep it, and the accompanying design system, current and continually evolving.</h4>
            <!-- <h3 class="paragraph-header">Expanded Component and Icon Library</h3> -->
            <!-- <p class="paragraph-copy">One area of the Giant Design System that will continually grow is our library of components and icons. There are near endless combinations of ways to create new design components and accompanying icons, and as the agency gets confronted with new design challenges from clients, our libraries will continue to expand.</p> -->
