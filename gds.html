This system consists of some of the most common components used in healthcare and pharma websites.</h4>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Problem</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">Evoke Giant  was looking for guidance in best practices when designing for websites to ensure industry standard design solutions were being utilized. It would allow their art teams to focus their energy on creative concepting and bringing their client’s brands to life without the need to worry about usability heuristics and web design standards.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Solution</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I created what I’ve called the Giant Design System — or GDS. It’s a library of the most common design components used in healthcare and pharma websites assembled using <a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Brad Frost’s Atomic Design Methodology</a>. It’s designed in such a way that the elements can be mixed and matched to come up with new creative website layouts. Each component can be visually personalized to meet each client’s brand needs, while the underlying functionality stays the same.</p>
            <h3 class="paragaph-header">Team and Role</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>UX/UI designer — myself</li>
              <li>Director of UX — Gail Cruz</li>
              <li>UX strategist — Emily Schepp</li>
              <li>VP of technology — Andrew Wint</li>

            <h2>Components</h2>
            <h4>I completed an analysis and compiled a list of design elements used in biotechnology and pharmaceutical websites both those done by Evoke Giant, as well as brands worked on by competitor agencies. I worked closely with our UX strategist and director of UX to focus the list of components needed for the initial launch of GDS.</h4>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Typography</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I established a typographic heirarchy  for the GDS that could be used across any project. It provides an example of appropriate type sizing, agnostic of typeface, font weight, and case.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-copy">I created a color palette to be used for the GDS that expands upon Evoke Giant’s corporate colors. It’s meant to serve as an example for color selection and will obviously be replaced by a client’s own brand colors.</p>

            <h2>Common design patterns</h2>
            <h4>I created designs for some of the most frequently used design patterns, including how they translate to mobile. Often the transition to mobile is a responsive solution, but occasionally it must be adaptive.</h4>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Tabs and tables</h3>

              <div class="pattern-copy-1">
                <h4>1. Tabs and accordions</h4>
                <p>Tabs are a common solution for displaying multiple blocks of data, though often don't translate well to mobile. Using accordions on mobile are an appropriate adaptive solution.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="pattern-copy-2">
                <h4>2. Tables</h4>
                <p>Tables are necessary for displaying data on pharmaceutical websites. They also translate well to mobile with little issue.</p>

              <div class="pattern-copy-1">
                <h4>1. References as tooltips</h4>
                <p>Pharmaceutical companies rely on peer-reviewed research to justify the efficacy claims they make. Clickable tooltips are a great method for providing instant access to these references; they also translate responsively to mobile.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="pattern-copy-2">
                <h4>2. Toggle switches</h4>
                <p>Switches are useful for toggling between two sets of data, two charts, or really any two elements that belong together. They can be converted responsively or adaptively as accordions in mobile.</p>

              <h4>1. Carousels</h4>
              <p>Carousels are used to show a large collection of similar content, such as a library of videos. They translate responsively to mobile as long as the design makes clear through the use of breadcrumbs and content that bleeds off the screen that there is more to be seen.</p>

            <div class="pattern-copy">
              <h4>1. Menus</h4>
              <p>A large dropdown menu on desktop, sometimes called a mega menu, can be used to show a robust or complex collection of subpages. When translated to mobile, accordion functionality is a nice solution.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="section next-section">
            <div id="next-anchor"></div>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <h4>The GDS is a living, breathing system that will never truly be finished. It must grow and adapt as the needs of the business, and our clients, evolve. What is amazing about building a design system at an agency is that for every new client project, there's an opportunity to expand upon the system as we take into account the unique needs of each client.</h4>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Expanded Component and Icon Library</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">One area of the Giant Design System that will continually grow is our library of components and icons. There are near endless combinations of ways to create new design components and accompanying icons, and as the agency gets confronted with new design challenges from clients, our libraries will continue to expand.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Translation into Code</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I have begun working with our development team to translate the design system's elements into coded components in our agency’s React codebase. Having the functionality and layout of each component coded out ahead of time will save the dev team massive amounts of time when building new projects since they simply need to adjust the styling of each component as opposed to building it from scratch.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Incorporate Usage Rules</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">Creating the usage documentation for the design system is needed next. This will ensure that anyone looking to borrow elements from the system incorporates them correctly into their designs.</p>
