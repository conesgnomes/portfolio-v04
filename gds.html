            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h4>At <a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.evokegiant.com/">Evoke Giant</a>, a health-focused advertising and strategic branding agency located in San Francisco, I helped create a design system that could be used as a jumping off point for digital projects.  This system consists of the most common components used in digital healthcare, allowing the creative teams at Giant to focus their efforts on bringing their clients’ brands to life visually without the need to reinvent many of the universal elements found across the digital landscape.</h4>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Problem</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">Evoke Giant  was looking for guidance in best practices when designing for digital projects (specifically websites, banner ads, and email blasts) to ensure industry standard design solutions were being utilized. It would allow their art teams to focus their energy on creative concepting and bringing their client’s brands to life without the need to worry about usability heuristics and web design standards.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Solution</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I created what I’ve called the Giant Design System — or GDS. It’s a library of the most common design components used in healthcare websites assembled using <a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Brad Frost’s Atomic Design Methodology</a> that are reusable across many of the digital projects at Evoke Giant.  It’s designed in such a way that allows the agency’s art teams to mix and match the elements they need to come up with new creative solutions for their client’s digital problems. Each component can be visually personalized to meet the client’s brand needs, while the underlying functionality stays the same.</p>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Research</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I completed an analysis of design elements currently used in pharmaceutical and medical device websites, emails, and banner ads, both those done by Evoke Giant, as well as brands worked on by competitor agencies, to establish list of components to include in the Giant Design System. I also worked closely with our UX Strategist and Director of UX to focus the list of components needed for the initial launch of GDS.</p>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Typography</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I established a typographic heirarchy  for the GDS that could be used across any project. It provides an example of appropriate type sizing, agnostic of typeface, font weight, and case.</p>

            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Color</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I created a color palette to be used for the GDS that expands upon Evoke Giant’s corporate colors. It’s meant to serve as an example for color selection and will obviously be replaced by a client’s own brand colors.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-copy">The beauty of the Giant Design System is its modular nature. In true atomic design fashion, each element can combined with other elements to create full page designs.</p>

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <h4>The GDS is a living, breathing system that will never truly be finished. It must grow and adapt as the needs of the business, and our clients, evolve. What is amazing about building a design system at an agency is that for every new client project, there's an opportunity to expand upon the system as we take into account the unique needs of each client.</h4>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Expanded Component Library</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">One area of the Giant Design System that will continually grow is our library of components. There are near endless combinations of ways to combine atoms to create new design components and as the agency gets confronted with new design challenges from clients, our component library will expand as a result.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Translation into Code</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">I have begun working with our development team to translate the design system's elements into coded components in our agency’s React codebase. Having the functionality and layout of each component coded out ahead of time will save the dev team massive amounts of time when building new projects since they simply need to adjust the styling of each component as opposed to building it from scratch. This is ultimately one of the greatest benefits of having a design system in place - not needing to reinvent the wheel and start development from scratch with every project.</p>
            <h3 class="paragraph-header">Incorporate Usage Rules</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-copy">Creating the usage documentation for the design system is needed next. This will ensure that anyone looking to borrow elements from the system incorporates them correctly into their designs.</p>
